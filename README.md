This modpack was created for Fuego Fish's (formerly) SA Traditional Games Discord server. Zereth did most of the work putting this together with some kubejs hacking from myself (Flail Snail), files from the All The Mods team, and other server residents. If you worked on this and want to be credited, hit me up on Discord or submit a PR.

Zereth unfortunately passed on October 21, 2024. Unless other server members wish to continue working on this pack, this repo can simply continue existing as a memorial.

The state of this repository as of the commit that added this file represents the latest and greatest of that modpack. It's perfectly playable if you zip the contents of the innermost TGPack directory and then import it into your modpack launcher of choice. We recommend Prism.
